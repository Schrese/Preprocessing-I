      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I first encountered Llamas when I was around four years old. They were so cute and cuddly, they were protectors of the herd and they regarded me as such... until that one fateful day. I was in my car when the asteroid came down, I saw the asteroid streak across the sky, in a great spectacle of orange of purple. I remember getting out of the car and looking in the direction it was heading towards, when a bright purple light enveloped the sky, the signs that the asteroid had impacted. In the following days the speculation was that this asteroid was harmless, and that the following cloudy days that resounded world-wide were merely because of the disturbance in the atmosphere. While most bought this explanation, I decided to put my web development career on break in order to do some research, and what I found astonished me. After receiving very few answers about the impact of this asteroid on this plante, I went to my parents' house to take a break and get away from my research. I went out to the pastures with the sheep and goats to say hello to my llama friends/protectors, but they regarded me with a gaze similar to the one that they used on predators that threatened their flock. But there was one small difference in their gaze, it was predatory, they saw me as a meal, and seemed to be staring directly into my soul.<br> I began to go around to the other pastures of our neighbors and found that the look was the exact same, and there began my research...</p>
